SCEMATK is an all in one tool for the analysis of WSI's via morphological profiling and spatial statistics. It was developed by Hugh Warden, a Phd student at the Institute of Genetics and Cancer, part of the University of Edinburgh. SCEMATK was made as part of a project looking at morphological properties of cells in the early stages of cancer, looking at how this differs over time and with different oncogenic mutations.
